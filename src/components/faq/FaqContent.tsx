                                HashStrat is a new DeFi protocol to help you invest in digital assets with a long-term outlook.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You select which assets you want to hold (e.g. BTC &amp; ETH), pick your favourite management strategy (e.g. Rebalancing, Mean Reversion, etc. ) and the protocol takes care of the rest. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Your management strategy will determine your initial portfolio allocation and will automate risk management.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Your strategies decide when to buy more of your favourite assets and when to sell into USDC to offload some risk.

                        HashStrat can help you to be a more successful, long-term investor:

                            <li>
                                Select the assets you want to hold and the strategies that will manage your assets.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Deposit USDC into the pool identified by the assets/strategies you picked.

                            <li>
                                Sit back and let HashStrat manage your digital asset portfolio for you.

                        Decentralized Finance is a nascent industry and it's important to be aware of its risks.<br/>
                        These are the main risks that is worth considering when using a DeFi protocol like HashStrat: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Protocol risks: <br/>
                                Although great care is put into following programing best practices, 
                                HashStrat smart contracts could contain bugs and be subject to exploits. 
                                Be aware that in several situations DeFi protocols have been exploited and users lost access to their funds.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Digital Asset risks: <br/>
                                HashStat strategies trade a small number of top digital assets on the Polygon Network: USDC, WETH, WBTC.
                                In case of catastrophic events on the Polygon Network and Polygon Bridge, these assets could, in theory, loose value against 
                                their pegged tokens (BTC on the Bitcoin network, ETH and USDC on the Ethereum network).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Smart contract integration risks: <br/>
                                In order to enable strategy trading, HashStat integrates a limited number of high-profile thirt-party protocols: <Link href="https://chain.link/" target="_blank"> Chainlink </Link> data-feeds, <Link href="https://quickswap.exchange/" target="_blank">QuickSwap DEX</Link>. 
                                <br/>
                                Issues with these protocols could impact HashStat strategies, halting their functions or altering their behaviour.
                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Network risks: <br/>
                                The HashStrat protocol runs on a blockchain, 
                                the <Link href="https://polygon.technology/" target="_blank">Polygon Network</Link>, that could suffer from malfunctions and exploits. <br/>
                                Issues at the base layer of a blockchian are very rare but can't be totally discounted. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Regulatory risks: <br/>
                                Owning crypto assets and using DeFi is perfectly legal in <Link href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/04/27/bitcoin-ban-these-are-the-countries-where-crypto-is-restricted-or-illegal2" target="_blank"> almost </Link> every
